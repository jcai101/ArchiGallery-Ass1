        <strong>National Museum - Central California</strong> 
        <br> Imagine a grand building with a majestic facade that catches the eye from afar. As you approach, you notice that the most striking feature of the building are the massive columns that adorn its front, stretching up to the roof. However, these columns are not placed in the traditional vertical orientation, but instead, they are set at a dramatic diagonal angle, creating an intriguing optical illusion.
        Each column is made of smooth, polished marble, and stands at least three stories tall, with a diameter that would require several people to wrap their arms around it. The diagonal angle of the columns gives the impression that they are leaning towards the building, providing a sense of dynamic movement and energy to the structure.

        <strong>Artic Housing - Eastern Greenland</strong> 
        <br> Isolated housing in the Arctic presents unique challenges and opportunities for architecture and design. The harsh, icy environment demands a structure that can withstand extreme cold, high winds, and heavy snow loads, while also providing a comfortable living space for its inhabitants.
        The architecture of isolated housing in the Arctic is characterized by its simplicity and functionality. The design is often minimalistic, with clean lines and geometric shapes that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The structures are typically built on a raised foundation, to prevent the building from being buried in snowdrifts during the winter months.

        <strong>Vertical Jungle - Barbados</strong>
        <br> Vertical jungle infrastructure involves the use of plants and vegetation that are specifically chosen for their ability to thrive in vertical environments. The walls are built with a structure that supports the weight of the plants, and a system for irrigation that ensures the plants receive the water and nutrients they need to survive.
        These vertical gardens offer a range of benefits for both the building and its surrounding environment. They help to reduce the urban heat island effect by providing shade and evapotranspiration, which cools the surrounding air. They also absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants, improving air quality and creating a healthier living environment for the building's occupants.

        <strong>Wave Library - China</strong>
        <br>The Wave library is housed in a vast, 5-storey atrium, which is dominated by a series of sweeping, undulating bookshelves that rise up from the floor and curve over the heads of visitors. The shelves are designed to create a wave-like effect that gives the library its name, and also serves as an acoustical barrier, helping to reduce noise levels within the building.
        The shelves are made from white-painted metal, which contrasts beautifully with the polished concrete floor and walls of the atrium. The design also includes a series of large, circular openings that allow natural light to flood the interior spaces, creating a bright and welcoming environment for visitors.

        <strong>Chitauri - Brazil</strong>
        <br> The cathedral's unique design is immediately recognizable, with its dramatic hyperboloid structure rising up to a height of 75 meters. The structure is made up of 16 concrete columns, each weighing 90 tons, which support the cathedral's roof. The columns are arranged in a circular pattern, and are meant to resemble the hands of a person reaching up towards the heavens.
        The roof of the cathedral is made up of 16 curved panels, each made from fiberglass and reinforced with steel. The panels are arranged in a pattern that creates a sense of movement and dynamism, as if the roof is floating above the columns.

        <strong>Hill Home - Siberia</strong>
        <br> The use of earth-sheltering techniques would also help to insulate the house and keep it warm during the long, cold winters.
        The house could be designed with large windows or skylights that take advantage of natural light and allow for stunning views of the surrounding landscape. A solar heating system could be incorporated into the design to provide additional warmth and energy efficiency during the winter months.
